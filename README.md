## University Website

This is a website for the COE 538 Microprocessors course in Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University). The current official website is purely HTML and this new website provides a better user experience for any students taking the course. This was done as a personal project, it's not official and should not be used as it is.

# Tools Used

- HTML for displaying the content
- CSS and Styled Components for styling the website
- Javascript for rendering the content on the website and for dynamic behaviour
- React for creating reusable components and help with management of data
- JSON for storing data
